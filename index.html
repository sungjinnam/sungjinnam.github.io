<p>My name is Sungjin Nam.</p>
<p>
    I am interested in building natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) applications for educational technology applications, such as evaluation, language learning, user engagement, and content improvements.

<p>
    Currently, I am a Senior Research Scientist at ACT, Inc. (2021-), developing an automated essay scoring engine (CRASE+) and NLP/ML applications for automatic content generation.
    I worked as a Data Scientist at Pearson (2020-2021), developing AI/ML features and backend components of the calculus tutoring app, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220829123707/https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/products-services-teaching/learning-engagement-tools/aida.html" target="_blank">Aida Calculus</a>.

    In 2020, I completed my doctorate degree at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/" target="_blank">School of Information, University of Michigan</a>, advised by <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~kevynct/" target="_blank">Prof. Kevyn Collins-Thompson</a>. My thesis was about developing machine learning capabilities for an intelligent tutoring system, including predicting learner engagement, interpretable scales for evaluating open-ended responses, and designing language learning curricula.

    Before my Ph.D., I received a BA degree in <a href="http://psych.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Psychology</a> and <a href="http://isc.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Information Science & Culture</a> from Seoul National University, and an MS degree in <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Information</a> (Spcialized in Information Analysis & Retrieval and Human-Computer Interaction) from the University of Michigan.

    During my personal time, I enjoy working on sound design and music production.
