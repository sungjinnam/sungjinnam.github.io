In my research career, I've focused on applying natural language processing techniques to educational technology. This journey has taken me from academic research to practical applications in real-world learning environments.

## Early Research

During my Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, I explored how machine learning models could be used to understand and predict learner engagement in intelligent tutoring systems. This work laid the foundation for my continued interest in educational applications.

## Industry Applications

At Pearson, I worked on the Aida Calculus tutoring system, where I developed AI/ML features that helped students learn calculus more effectively. This experience showed me the power of combining educational theory with cutting-edge technology.

## Current Work

At ACT, Inc., I'm developing CRASE+, an automated essay scoring engine that aims to provide fair and accurate assessment of student writing. This work combines my interests in NLP, machine learning, and educational assessment.

## Future Directions

I'm excited about the future of AI in education and look forward to continuing to develop technologies that enhance learning experiences for students around the world.
